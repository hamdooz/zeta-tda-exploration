Exploratory computational study on the zeros of the Riemann zeta function using topological data analysis.
# Zeta Zeros and Topological Data Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory Jupyter notebook investigating whether
methods from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can provide additional structural
insight into the distribution of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function.

The study is computational and exploratory in nature, and the observed behavior
is consistent with known results from random matrix theory.
